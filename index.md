## Pak Urdu Phonetic

[Pak Urdu Phonetic](https://barqx.github.io/pak-urdu-phonetic/){:target="_blank"} is an Urdu keyboard layout faithfully ported from the popular Windows-based Pak Urdu Installer layout by mBilalm. It offers the same simple, intuitive phonetic typing experience and brings this widely adopted standard to the Keyman platform for cross-platform use.

With over 160+ unique key mappings across regular, Shift, AltGr (Right Alt), and Shift+AltGr combinations, this layout offers the most complete phonetic Urdu typing solution available — more comprehensive than any previous Urdu keyboard layout to date.
